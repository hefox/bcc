  From his obituary:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Peter James Austin died at 2 a.m., Wednesday, Feb. 13, on the 5th floor of Mount Zion Hospital after a 21-month struggle with AIDS. Both his mother, Mildred Austin, and his lover of three years, Ken McMullen, were at his side. He died as he wanted to, without pain, quickly, and in full control. Peter was born in the Thousand Island area of Upstate New York, and spent his first few years of life between the beaches of the St. Lawrence River and the beaches of Rio de janeiro, Brazil.</p>
  <p>He graduated from Upstate Medical Center at S.U.N.Y. at at Syracuse, N.Y., in 1978 with a degree in Respiratory Therapy and the Humanities. He moved August 1978 working as a Respiratory Care Practitioner at  Stanford Hospital, Palo Alto.   Peter met fellow Saggitarian and life partner, Charles David Mast, in San Francisco and they took up residence together in 1978 in the Noe Valley district of SF. Mr. Mast passed away in May 1990.</p>
  <p>Professionally, Peter began working at Seton Medical Center, Daly City, in the Respiratory Care Services Department. In 1981 he became a supervisor of the Respiratory Care Department at Children's Hospital, Oakland, where he became Manager of the Pulmonary Function Lab in 1986. He remained there as manager until his medical retirement.</p>
  <p>In San Francisco, Peter enjoyed the various aspects of the Bay Area outdoors. Frequent trips to the Russian River, Lake Tahoe, San Gregorio, San Diego and Palm Springs would occupy his time when he was not attending local music and dance events. Eventually, he discovered South of Market. During his explorations of the leather scene he would meet the man to accompany him out of the '80s and into the '90s, his lover, Ken McMullen.</p>
  <p>Peter also enjoyed photography, at both ends of the camera. After competing for the AIDS Emergency Fund's Eagle Bare Chest Calendar he won the cover spot and graced the cover for 1989. That same year he competed for and won the title of Mr. Eagle
Leather '89. The momentum continued as he then competed for and won the title of Mr. San Francisco Leather 1989. He would compete Internationally that year in Chicago one week after receiving his AIDS diagnosis.</p>
  <p>As Mr. San Francisco Leather 1989, he was active in multiple
fundraising events for AIDS charities in the Bay Area. Through videotape and photographs he made his presence felt in San Francisco and other locales. Peter represented San Francisco at the International Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia.</p>
  <p>Shortly before retiring his title he became a founding board
member of SMMILE [South of Market Merchants’ and Lifestyle
Events). SMMILE produces the UP YOUR ALLEY STREET FAIR and the FOLSOM STREET FAIR. [...]. Peter had said, “Those wishing to honor my memory are sincerely requested to do nothing of a religious or otherwise trivial nature but instead to make a donation to the AIDS organization of their choice.”</p>
