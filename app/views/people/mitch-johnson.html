  From his obituary:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>My love, my friend and my confidant has departed. No longer is he enduring the constant pain of his illness. At life's end, the man I adored with all my heart slipped away peacefully. While in good health, he constantly sought the many pleasures of life, and was always willing and able to contribute his talents to the community. He enjoyed the company of his friends, setting sail on his boat, riding his motorcycle, going South of Market. AIDS would not allow much of this activity to continue, and he was forced to seek simpler pleasures at home.</p>
<p>Mitch was well-known in San Francisco and beyond. He worked with Coming Home Hospice in the mid-80s. Becoming more visible and active, he dedicated himself to the gym, competing in Physique '89 and gracing both the 1990 and 1991 Eagle Bare Chest calendars. In 1991 he continued his involvernent with the leather community by becoming Mr. SF Eagle, Mr. San Francisco Leather, and placing third in the International Mr. Leather competition. He later became a member of the board of directors of the AIDS Emergency Fund and worked closely with members of the fundraising committees until his health prevented him from participating. Mitch worked tirelessly at community events, always with pleasure, pride and his irresistible smile.</p>
<p>When he became more homebound, it was the love of his family, friends, and God that maintained his spirits and smile. The calls and visits he received were some of the best drugs
available.</p>
<p>Mitch, you got my attention with your good looks and warm blue eyes. Soon, I fell in love with you and your many talents, wit and intelligence. I miss you beyond what I thought possible. You enriched my life, and I'm privileged to have been with you in health and in sickness.</p>
