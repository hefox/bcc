  From his obituary:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Michael departed his beloved California from his familial home in Oxnard, surrounded by his loving family. A mass was celebrated on Jan. 25 with funeral arrangements by Condrad-Caroll Mortuary. He had left San Francisco late in 1994 with a debilitating sickness not associated with AIDS.</p>
  <p>[...]</p>
  <p>A graduate of Oxnard High School, Michael also attended Lumbleau Real Estate School in 1978, Laney College in 1979-80 and business courses at San Francisco City College. After completing honorable  service in the U.S. Marine Corps, Michael moved to the Bay Area and settled in San Francisco, where he began his 10-year career as a securities analyst with Bank of America.</p>
  <p>He formed M.C. Productions and United Alliance and produced numerous fundraising events to beneÔ¨Åt Project Open Hand, the Shanti Project and the AIDS Emergency Fund. He was also employed by Mellon Capital Mgmt. Corp and Madsen Personnel Services. Even with a fast-paced schedule, Michael also managed to find time to tend bar in various places in San Francisco and at the Renegades bar in San Jose. </p>
  <p>Michael will always be remembered in the South of Market community as an outstanding example of leather pride. His extreme devotion to his leather brothers and sisters was manifested in all the occasions he served as a judge for the bare chest and great buns contests, leather bar title contests and master of ceremonies for both calendar auctions.</p>
  <p>Michael was not a joiner but did support all the worthy fundraising events in San Francisco. His impeccable leather outfits and uniforms were always a delight to observe. His smiling personality, friendly attitude and outgoing demeanor were welcome sights in the various areas of his interest. It was a pleasure to be around him and his positive attitude. The leather community especially and other areas of San Francisco mourn the loss of Michael Chase. He will long be remembered for his kindness and caring.</p>
